          <div class="textbox">
            <p>With an insatiable curiosity and an agile mind, Ilya is a clever and resourceful woman, perpetually eager to explore and discover ever more about the world around her.
            She is eternally questioning, both within and without, and more than one hapless victim has been trapped beneath a flurry of questions.  Despite her willingness to pursue 
            information, however, she should not be mistaken for outgoing; indeed, unless her curiosity is well piqued, it is rare for her to approach a stranger.  Instead, in crowds, 
            she can most often be found occupying her time with people-watching silently.
            </p>
            <p>Though not shy, as such, Ilyanith is socially awkward and frequently socially inept (and oblivious).  As such, she is prone to missing sometimes seemingly obvious social
             cues, apologizes often to excess out of an uncertainty as to whether or not she has commited some social faux pas, and blushes frequently and easily, much to her chagrin.
            </p>
            <p>None of this, however, should be taken to mean that she is a fearful creature.  Though she seeks to avoid such awkwardness where possible, given the proper motivation, 
            she can be fiercely passionate and even bold.  Ilya is marked by a strong, possibly overdeveloped sense of justice, quick to stick up for the underdog and only too willing to
             leap to the defense of the perceived defenseless, whether they ask it of her or no - a tendency that has more than once gotten her into trouble.
